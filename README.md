## iOS OVO Layout Clone
OVO Layout Clone is project that I work on for personal learning purposes, specifically in using UIKit to create ui components and layouting them.
I use OVO Indonesia mobile app for references as I like their ui design and use the app frequently (🙇‍♂️🙏). The data used is mock only.

## Scope UI
- [x] Home Screen
- [ ] Financial Screen (wip)
- [ ] Inbox Screen 
- [ ] Profile Screen

# Specs
* iOS 13 and later
* UIKit
